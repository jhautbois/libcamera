 * Algorithms shall use this data to run calculations and update their state

 *
 * Processing shall not take an undue amount of time, and any extended or

 * Algorithms can store state in their respective IPAFrameContext structures,

 * Either the previous frame, or the IPAFrameContext state of the frame
 * that generated the statistics for this operation may be required for
 * some advanced algorithms to prevent oscillations or support control
 * loops correctly. Only a single IPAFrameContext is available currently,
 * and so any data stored may represent the results of the previously
 * completed operations.
 *
 * Care shall be taken to ensure the ordering of access to the information
 * such that the algorithms use up to date state as required.
