  - AeMeteringMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify a metering mode for the AE algorithm to use. The metering
        modes determine which parts of the image are used to determine the
        scene brightness. Metering modes may be platform specific and not
        all metering modes may be supported.

  # - Auto-generate max enum value.
  # - Better handling of custom types.
  - AeConstraintMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify a constraint mode for the AE algorithm to use. These determine
        how the measured scene brightness is adjusted to reach the desired
        target exposure. Constraint modes may be platform specific, and not
        all constraint modes may be supported.
      enum:
        - name: ConstraintNormal
          value: 0
          description: Default constraint mode.
            This mode aims to balance the exposure of different parts of the
            image so as to reach a reasonable average level. However, highlights
            in the image may appear over-exposed and lowlights may appear
            under-exposed.
        - name: ConstraintHighlight
          value: 1
          description: Highlight constraint mode.
            This mode adjusts the exposure levels in order to try and avoid
            over-exposing the brightest parts (highlights) of an image.
            Other non-highlight parts of the image may appear under-exposed.
        - name: ConstraintShadows
          value: 2
          description: Shadows constraint mode.
            This mode adjusts the exposure levels in order to try and avoid
            under-exposing the dark parts (shadows) of an image. Other normally
            exposed parts of the image may appear over-exposed.

  # AeExposureMode needs further attention:
  # - Auto-generate max enum value.
  # - Better handling of custom types.
  - AeExposureMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify an exposure mode for the AE algorithm to use. These specify
        how the desired total exposure is divided between the shutter time
        and the sensor's analogue gain. The exposure modes are platform
        specific, and not all exposure modes may be supported.
      enum:
        - name: ExposureNormal
          value: 0
          description: Default exposure mode.
        - name: ExposureShort
          value: 1
          description: Exposure mode allowing only short exposure times.

  - ExposureValue:
      type: float
      description: |
        Specify an Exposure Value (EV) parameter. The EV parameter will only be
        applied if the AE algorithm is currently enabled.

        By convention EV adjusts the exposure as log2. For example
        EV = [-2, -1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2] results in an exposure adjustment
        of [1/4x, 1/2x, 1/sqrt(2)x, 1x, sqrt(2)x, 2x, 4x].

        \sa AeEnable

  - ExposureTime:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Exposure time (shutter speed) for the frame applied in the sensor
        device. This value is specified in micro-seconds.

        Setting this value means that it is now fixed and the AE algorithm may
        not change it. Setting it back to zero returns it to the control of the
        AE algorithm.

        \sa AnalogueGain AeEnable

        \todo Document the interactions between AeEnable and setting a fixed
        value for this control. Consider interactions with other AE features,
        such as aperture and aperture/shutter priority mode, and decide if
        control of which features should be automatically adjusted shouldn't
        better be handled through a separate AE mode control.

  - AnalogueGain:
      type: float
      description: |
        Analogue gain value applied in the sensor device.
        The value of the control specifies the gain multiplier applied to all
        colour channels. This value cannot be lower than 1.0.

        Setting this value means that it is now fixed and the AE algorithm may
        not change it. Setting it back to zero returns it to the control of the
        AE algorithm.

        \sa ExposureTime AeEnable

        \todo Document the interactions between AeEnable and setting a fixed
        value for this control. Consider interactions with other AE features,
        such as aperture and aperture/shutter priority mode, and decide if
        control of which features should be automatically adjusted shouldn't
        better be handled through a separate AE mode control.

  - Brightness:
      type: float
      description: |
        Specify a fixed brightness parameter. Positive values (up to 1.0)
        produce brighter images; negative values (up to -1.0) produce darker
        images and 0.0 leaves pixels unchanged.

  - Contrast:
      type: float
      description:  |
        Specify a fixed contrast parameter. Normal contrast is given by the
        value 1.0; larger values produce images with more contrast.

  - Lux:
      type: float
      description: |
        Report an estimate of the current illuminance level in lux. The Lux
        control can only be returned in metadata.

  - AwbLocked:
      type: bool
      description: |
        Report the lock status of a running AWB algorithm.

        If the AWB algorithm is locked the value shall be set to true, if it's

  - ColourGains:
      type: float
      description: |
        Pair of gain values for the Red and Blue colour channels, in that
        order. ColourGains can only be applied in a Request when the AWB is
        disabled.

        \sa AwbEnable
      size: [2]

  - ColourTemperature:
      type: int32_t
      description: Report the current estimate of the colour temperature, in
        kelvin, for this frame. The ColourTemperature control can only be
        returned in metadata.

  - Saturation:
      type: float
      description:  |
        Specify a fixed saturation parameter. Normal saturation is given by
        the value 1.0; larger values produce more saturated colours; 0.0
        produces a greyscale image.

  - SensorBlackLevels:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Reports the sensor black levels used for processing a frame, in the
        order R, Gr, Gb, B. These values are returned as numbers out of a 16-bit
        pixel range (as if pixels ranged from 0 to 65535). The SensorBlackLevels
        control can only be returned in metadata.
      size: [4]

  - Sharpness:
      type: float
      description:  |
        A value of 0.0 means no sharpening. The minimum value means
        minimal sharpening, and shall be 0.0 unless the camera can't
        disable sharpening completely. The default value shall give a
        "reasonable" level of sharpening, suitable for most use cases.
        The maximum value may apply extremely high levels of sharpening,
        higher than anyone could reasonably want. Negative values are
        not allowed. Note also that sharpening is not applied to raw
        streams.

  - FocusFoM:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Reports a Figure of Merit (FoM) to indicate how in-focus the frame is.
        A larger FocusFoM value indicates a more in-focus frame. This control
        depends on the IPA to gather ISP statistics from the defined focus
        region, and combine them in a suitable way to generate a FocusFoM value.
        In this respect, it is not necessarily aimed at providing a way to
        implement a focus algorithm by the application, rather an indication of
        how in-focus a frame is.

  - ColourCorrectionMatrix:
      type: float
      description: |
        The 3x3 matrix that converts camera RGB to sRGB within the
        imaging pipeline. This should describe the matrix that is used
        after pixels have been white-balanced, but before any gamma
        transformation. The 3x3 matrix is stored in conventional reading
        order in an array of 9 floating point values.

      size: [3x3]

  - ScalerCrop:
      type: Rectangle
      description: |
        Sets the image portion that will be scaled to form the whole of
        the final output image. The (x,y) location of this rectangle is
        relative to the PixelArrayActiveAreas that is being used. The units
        remain native sensor pixels, even if the sensor is being used in
        a binning or skipping mode.

        This control is only present when the pipeline supports scaling. Its
        maximum valid value is given by the properties::ScalerCropMaximum
        property, and the two can be used to implement digital zoom.

  - DigitalGain:
      type: float
      description: |
        Digital gain value applied during the processing steps applied
        to the image as captured from the sensor.

        The global digital gain factor is applied to all the colour channels
        of the RAW image. Different pipeline models are free to
        specify how the global gain factor applies to each separate
        channel.

        If an imaging pipeline applies digital gain in distinct
        processing steps, this value indicates their total sum.
        Pipelines are free to decide how to adjust each processing
        step to respect the received gain factor and shall report
        their total value in the request metadata.

  - FrameDuration:
      type: int64_t
      description: |
        The instantaneous frame duration from start of frame exposure to start
        of next exposure, expressed in microseconds. This control is meant to
        be returned in metadata.

  - FrameDurationLimits:
      type: int64_t
      description: |
        The minimum and maximum (in that order) frame duration,
        expressed in microseconds.

        When provided by applications, the control specifies the sensor frame
        duration interval the pipeline has to use. This limits the largest
        exposure time the sensor can use. For example, if a maximum frame
        duration of 33ms is requested (corresponding to 30 frames per second),
        the sensor will not be able to raise the exposure time above 33ms.
        A fixed frame duration is achieved by setting the minimum and maximum
        values to be the same. Setting both values to 0 reverts to using the
        IPA provided defaults.

        The maximum frame duration provides the absolute limit to the shutter
        speed computed by the AE algorithm and it overrides any exposure mode
        setting specified with controls::AeExposureMode. Similarly, when a
        manual exposure time is set through controls::ExposureTime, it also
        gets clipped to the limits set by this control. When reported in
        metadata, the control expresses the minimum and maximum frame
        durations used after being clipped to the sensor provided frame
        duration limits.

        \sa AeExposureMode
        \sa ExposureTime

        \todo Define how to calculate the capture frame rate by
        defining controls to report additional delays introduced by
        the capture pipeline or post-processing stages (ie JPEG
        conversion, frame scaling).

        \todo Provide an explicit definition of default control values, for
        this and all other controls.

      size: [2]

  - SensorTimestamp:
      type: int64_t
      description: |
        The time when the first row of the image sensor active array is exposed.

        The timestamp, expressed in nanoseconds, represents a monotonically
        increasing counter since the system boot time, as defined by the
        Linux-specific CLOCK_BOOTTIME clock id.

        The SensorTimestamp control can only be returned in metadata.

        \todo Define how the sensor timestamp has to be used in the reprocessing
        use case.

  - AfMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Control to set the mode of the AF (autofocus) algorithm. Applications
        are allowed to set a new mode, and to send additional controls for
        that new mode, in the same request.

        An implementation may choose not to implement all the modes.

      enum:
        - name: AfModeManual
          value: 0
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in manual mode. In this mode it will never
            perform any action nor move the lens of its own accord, but an
            application can set controls to move the lens.

            In this mode the AfState will always report AfStateManual.
        - name: AfModeAuto
          value: 1
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in auto mode. This means that the algorithm
            will never move the lens or change state unless the AfTrigger
            control is used. The AfTrigger control can be used to initiate a
            focus scan, the results of which will also be reported by AfState.

            If the autofocus algorithm is moved from AfModeAuto to another
            mode while a scan is in progress, the scan is cancelled
            immediately, without waiting for the scan to finish.

            When first entering this mode the AfState will report
            AfStateAuto. When a trigger control is sent, AfState will
            report AfStateAutoScanning for a period before spontaneously
            changing to AfStateAutoFocused or AfStateAutoFailed, depending on
            the outcome of the scan. It will remain in this state until
            another scan is initiated by the AfTrigger control. If a scan is
            cancelled (without changing to another mode), AfState will return
            to AfStateAuto.
        - name: AfModeContinuous
          value: 2
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in continuous mode. This means that the lens
            can re-start a scan spontaneously at any moment, without any user
            intervention. The AfState still reports whether the algorithm is
            currently scanning or not, though the application has no ability
            to initiate or cancel scans (though it can "pause" them), nor to
            move the lens for itself.

            When set to AfModeContinuous, the system will immediately initiate
            a scan so AfState will report AfStateContinuousScanning, and will
            settle on one of AfStateContinuousFocused or AfStateContinuousFailed,
            depending on the scan result.

  - AfLensPosition:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Control to set the position of the lens to one of the following
        predefined locations. This control only has any effect when the AfMode
        is set to AfModeManual.

        This control is distinct from the LensPosition control, which sets the
        lens position using the lens driver's units.
      enum:
        - name: AfLensPositionMacro
          value: 0
          description: The closest focal position of the lens.
        - name: AfLensPositionHyperfocal
          value: 1
          description: Hyperfocal position.
        - name: AfLensPositionInfinity
          value: 2
          description: The furthest focal position (usually infinity).

  - AfRange:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Control to set the range of focus distances that is scanned. An
        implementation may choose not to implement all the options here.
      enum:
        - name: AfRangeNormal
          value: 0
          description: |
            A wide range of focus distances is scanned, all the way from
            infinity down to close distances, though depending on the
            implementation, possibly not including the very closest macro
            positions.
        - name: AfRangeMacro
          value: 1
          description: Only close distances are scanned.
        - name: AfRangeFull
          value: 2
          description: |
            The full range of focus distances is scanned just as with
            AfRangeNormal but this time including the very closest macro
            positions.

  - AfSpeed:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Control that determines whether the AF algorithm is to move the lens
        as quickly as possible or more steadily. For example, during video
        recording it may be desirable not to move the lens too abruptly, but
        when in a preview mode (waiting for a still capture) it may be
        helpful to move the lens as quickly as is reasonably possible.
      enum:
        - name: AfSpeedNormal
          value: 0
          description: Move the lens at its usual speed.
        - name: AfSpeedFast
          value: 1
          description: Move the lens more quickly.

  - AfWindows:
      type: Rectangle
      description: |
        Sets the focus windows used by the AF algorithm. The units used express
        a proportion of the ScalerCrop control (or if unavailable, of the entire
        image), as u0.16 format numbers.

        In order to be activated, a rectangle must be programmed with non-zero
        width and height. If no rectangles are programmed in this way, then the
        system will choose its own single default window in the centre of the
        image.

        The details of how the windows are used are platform dependent. We note
        that when there is more than one AF window, a typical implementation
        might find the optimal focus position for each one and finally select
        the window closest to the camera.

        size: [platform dependent]

  - AfTrigger:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        This control starts an autofocus scan when AfMode is set to AfModeAuto,
        and can also be used to terminate a scan early.

        It is ignored if AfMode is set to AfModeManual or AfModeContinuous.

      enum:
        - name: AfTriggerStart
          value: 0
          description: Start an AF scan. Ignored if a scan is in progress.
        - name: AfTriggerCancel
          value: 1
          description: Cancel an AF scan. This does not cause the lens to move
            anywhere else. Ignored if no scan is in progress.

  - AfPause:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        This control has no effect except when in continuous autofocus mode
        (AfModeContinuous). It can be used to pause any lens movements while
        (for example) images are captured. The algorithm remains inactive
        until it is instructed to resume.

      enum:
        - name: AfPauseImmediate
          value: 0
          description: |
            Pause the continuous autofocus algorithm immediately, whether or
            not any kind of scan is underway. If the AfState was previously
            reporting AfStateContinuousScanning it will now change to
            AfStateContinuousScanningPaused, and similarly for
            AfStateContinuousFocused and AfStateContinuousFailed.
        - name: AfPauseDeferred

  - LensPosition:

      description: |
        Acts as a control to instruct the lens to move to a particular position
        and also reports back the position of the lens for each frame.

        The units are determined by the lens driver.

        The LensPosition control is ignored unless the AfMode is set to
        AfModeManual.

        Note that this control is distinct from AfLensPosition, which allows
        the lens to be moved to its macro/hyperfocal/infinity position, rather
        than using lens driver units.

  - AfState:
      type: int32_t

        Reports the current state of the AF algorithm. The possible state changes
        are described below, although we add that the following general state
        changes are also allowed.

        In any of the AfStateManual or AfStateContinuous states, the AfMode
        may be set to AfModeAuto and the algorithm will move to the
        AfStateAuto state. If AfTriggerStart is sent at the same time
        then the algorithm will move to AfStateAutoScanning state.

        In any of the AfStateAuto or AfStateManual states, the AfMode may
        be set to AfModeContinuous and the algorithm will move to
        AfStateContinuousScanning.

        In any of the AfStateAuto or AfStateContinuous states, the AfMode may
        be set to AfModeManual and the algorithm will move to
        AfStateManual. The lens will not be moved and will be left where

        The typical value for this control is 3 as a frame is first exposed,

          value: 2
          description: |
            All pixel data is replaced with an 8-bar color pattern. The vertical
            bars (left-to-right) are as follows; white, yellow, cyan, green,
            magenta, red, blue and black. Each bar should take up 1/8 of the
            sensor pixel array width. When this is not possible, the bar size
            should be rounded down to the nearest integer and the pattern can
            repeat on the right side. Each bar's height must always take up the
            full sensor pixel array height.
        - name: TestPatternModeColorBarsFadeToGray
          value: 3
          description: |
            The test pattern is similar to TestPatternModeColorBars,
            except that each bar should start at its specified color at the top
            and fade to gray at the bottom. Furthermore each bar is further
            subdevided into a left and right half. The left half should have a
            smooth gradient, and the right half should have a quantized
            gradient. In particular, the right half's should consist of blocks
            of the same color for 1/16th active sensor pixel array width. The
            least significant bits in the quantized gradient should be copied
            from the most significant bits of the smooth gradient. The height of
            each bar should always be a multiple of 128. When this is not the
            case, the pattern should repeat at the bottom of the image.
        - name: TestPatternModePn9
          value: 4
          description: |
            All pixel data is replaced by a pseudo-random sequence generated
            from a PN9 512-bit sequence (typically implemented in hardware with
            a linear feedback shift register). The generator should be reset at
            the beginning of each frame, and thus each subsequent raw frame with
            this test pattern should be exactly the same as the last.
        - name: TestPatternModeCustom1
          value: 256
          description: |
            The first custom test pattern. All custom patterns that are
            available only on this camera device are at least this numeric
            value. All of the custom test patterns will be static (that is the
